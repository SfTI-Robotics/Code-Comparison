# <p>  Deep Reinforcement Learning Course is a free series of articles and videos tutorials üÜï about Deep Reinforcement Learning, where **we'll learn the main algorithms (Q-learning, Deep Q Nets, Dueling Deep Q Nets, Policy Gradients, A2C, Proximal Policy Gradients‚Ä¶), and how to implement them with Tensorflow.**
# <br><br>
#     
# üìúThe articles explain the architectures from the big picture to the mathematical details behind them.

# üìπ The videos explain how to build the agents with Tensorflow </b></p>
# <br>
# This course will give you a **solid foundation for understanding and implementing the future state of the art algorithms**. And, you'll build a strong professional portfolio by creating **agents that learn to play awesome environments**: Doom¬© üëπ, Space invaders üëæ, Outrun, Sonic the Hedgehog¬©, Michael Jackson‚Äôs Moonwalker, agents that will be able to navigate in 3D environments with DeepMindLab (Quake) and able to walk with Mujoco.

# ## Step 1: Import the libraries üìö

  
import tensorflow as tf      # Deep Learning library
import numpy as np           # Handle matrices
import retro                 # Retro Environment


from skimage import transform # Help us to preprocess the frames
from skimage.color import rgb2gray # Help us to gray our frames

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Display graphs

from collections import deque# Ordered collection with ends

import random

import warnings # This ignore all the warning messages that are normally printed during the training because of skiimage
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') 

 
# ## Step 2: Create our environment üéÆ
# This time we use **OpenAI Retro**, a wrapper for video game emulator cores using the Libretro API to turn them into Gym environments.

# ### Our environment
# Our Environment is the famous game Atari Space Invaders.
# 

  
# Create our environment
env = retro.make(game='SpaceInvaders-Atari2600')

print("The size of our frame is: ", env.observation_space)
print("The action size is : ", env.action_space.n)

# possible_actions = [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]...]
possible_actions = np.array(np.identity(env.action_space.n,dtype=int).tolist())

 
# ## Step 3 : Define the preprocessing functions ‚öôÔ∏è
# ### preprocess_frame
# Preprocessing is an important step, <b>because we want to reduce the complexity of our states to reduce the computation time needed for training.</b>
# <br><br>
# Our steps:
# - Grayscale each of our frames (because <b> color does not add important information </b>).
# - Crop the screen (in our case we remove the part below the player because it does not add any useful information)
# - We normalize pixel values
# - Finally we resize the preprocessed frame

  
"""

    Take a frame.
    Grayscale it

# ### stack_frames
# As explained in this really <a href="https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2016/11/25/frame-skipping-and-preprocessing-for-deep-q-networks-on-atari-2600-games/">  good article </a> we stack frames.
# 
# Stacking frames is really important because it helps us to **give have a sense of motion to our Neural Network.**
# 
# BUT, **we don't stack each frames, we skip 4 frames at each timestep**. This means that only every fourth frame is considered. And then, we use this frame to form the stack_frame.
# 
# **The frame skipping method is already implemented in the library.**
# 
# - First we preprocess frame
# - Then we append the frame to the deque that automatically **removes the oldest frame**
# - Finally we **build the stacked state**
# 
# This is how work stack:
# - For the first frame, we feed 4 frames
# - At each timestep, **we add the new frame to deque and then we stack them to form a new stacked frame**
# - And so on
# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/master/DQN/Space%20Invaders/assets/stack_frames.png" alt="stack">
# - If we're done, **we create a new stack with 4 new frames (because we are in a new episode)**.

  
stack_size = 4 # We stack 4 frames

# Initialize deque with zero-images one array for each image
stacked_frames  =  deque([np.zeros((110,84), dtype=np.int) for i in range(stack_size)], maxlen=4)

def stack_frames(stacked_frames, state, is_new_episode):
    # Preprocess frame
    frame = preprocess_frame(state)
    
    if is_new_episode:
        # Clear our stacked_frames
        stacked_frames = deque([np.zeros((110,84), dtype=np.int) for i in range(stack_size)], maxlen=4)
        
        # Because we're in a new episode, copy the same frame 4x
        stacked_frames.append(frame)
        stacked_frames.append(frame)
        stacked_frames.append(frame)
        stacked_frames.append(frame)
        
        # Stack the frames
        stacked_state = np.stack(stacked_frames, axis=2)
        
    else:
        # Append frame to deque, automatically removes the oldest frame

        # Build the stacked state (first dimension specifies different frames)
        stacked_state = np.stack(stacked_frames, axis=2) 
    
    return stacked_state, stacked_frames

 
# ## Step 4: Set up our hyperparameters ‚öóÔ∏è
# In this part we'll set up our different hyperparameters. But when you implement a Neural Network by yourself you will **not implement hyperparamaters at once but progressively**.
# 
# - First, you begin by defining the neural networks hyperparameters when you implement the model.
# - Then, you'll add the training hyperparameters when you implement the training algorithm.

  
### MODEL HYPERPARAMETERS
state_size = [110, 84, 4]      # Our input is a stack of 4 frames hence 110x84x4 (Width, height, channels) 
action_size = env.action_space.n # 8 possible actions
learning_rate =  0.00025      # Alpha (aka learning rate)

### TRAINING HYPERPARAMETERS
total_episodes = 50            # Total episodes for training
max_steps = 50000              # Max possible steps in an episode
batch_size = 64                # Batch size

# Exploration parameters for epsilon greedy strategy
explore_start = 1.0            # exploration probability at start
explore_stop = 0.01            # minimum exploration probability 
decay_rate = 0.00001           # exponential decay rate for exploration prob

# Q learning hyperparameters
gamma = 0.9                    # Discounting rate

### MEMORY HYPERPARAMETERS
pretrain_length = batch_size   # Number of experiences stored in the Memory when initialized for the first time
memory_size = 1000000          # Number of experiences the Memory can keep

### PREPROCESSING HYPERPARAMETERS
stack_size = 4                 # Number of frames stacked

### MODIFY THIS TO FALSE IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THE TRAINED AGENT
training = False

## TURN THIS TO TRUE IF YOU WANT TO RENDER THE ENVIRONMENT
