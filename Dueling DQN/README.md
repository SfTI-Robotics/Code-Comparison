## Overall differences

### Diff 1 : Keras vs Tensorflow
Using Keras simplifies the computation set up process the Keras functions combine multiple Tensorflow functions into one. 

### Diff 2 : Abstraction/encapsulation
More functions to avoid repetition of code.

## In depth comparison

### Learning algorithm 

#### Memory
